local completion_system_prompt =
[[Your task is to generate a code completion based on the filename, the current state of the code, and a given instruction. Before producing the code completion, you should reflect on the filename, the code, and the instruction to ensure you fully understand what is required. Your response should be formatted as follows:

- **Filename Reflection:** [Your reflection on the filename]
- **Code Reflection:** [Your reflection on the given code]
- **Instruction Reflection:** [Your interpretation of what the instruction is asking for]
- **Completion:** [The code that should follow the given code, adhering to the instruction, **without code block markers or additional explanations**]

**Guidelines:**

- The code completion is meant to **continue** the existing code, not replace it.
- **In the Completion section, provide only the code that completes the given code, without any code block markers, explanations, or additional text.**
- Ensure that your completion integrates seamlessly with the provided code and is appropriate for the specified filename.
- Focus on understanding the context and requirements before coding.
- Keep your reflections concise yet insightful.
